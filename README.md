# Chatbot

A lightweight, extensible chatbot project. This repository contains the code, configuration, and documentation for a conversational agent that can be extended to use different language models, connectors, and user interfaces.

## About

This project implements a chatbot that can be run locally or deployed to a server. It is designed to be modular so you can swap the model backend, add new connectors (Slack, Telegram, Web UI), or expand intents and response handlers.

Replace this paragraph with a short summary of your repository's purpose, intended users, and high-level architecture.

## Features

- Basic conversational flow and message handling
- Pluggable backend for model or rule-based logic
- REST API (and/or WebSocket) interface for clients
- Simple web UI for testing (if included)
- Dockerfile for containerized runs (if included)

Customize this list with the features actually present in your repository.

## Tech stack

- Languages: REPLACE_WITH_LANGUAGE(S) (e.g., Python, Node.js)
- Frameworks: REPLACE_WITH_FRAMEWORKS (e.g., FastAPI, Express, Flask, React)
- Model / Bot library: REPLACE_WITH_MODEL_OR_LIBRARY (e.g., OpenAI, Rasa, Botpress)
- Dev tools: Docker, npm/yarn, pip, Make, etc.

Update the entries above to reflect your repository's actual stack.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Node.js >= X.X (if Node used) or Python >= 3.X (if Python used)
- Docker (optional)
- Any API keys required for external models (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/mukulsharma1817-del/chatbot.git
   cd chatbot

2. Install dependencies:

- For Node.js:
  npm install
  or
  yarn install

- For Python:
  python -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt

(Adjust commands to match the repository.)

### Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root or export environment variables required by the app. Example variables:

- OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
- PORT=8000
- DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./db.sqlite3

Replace and extend with the real variables your project needs.

### Run locally

- Node.js example:
  npm run dev
  npm start

- Python example:
  uvicorn app.main:app --reload
  python main.py

- Docker:
  docker build -t chatbot .
  docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env chatbot

## Usage

### API (example)

If the project exposes a REST API, a typical request:

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"Hi, how are you?"}'

Response:
{
  "reply": "Hello! I'm a chatbot. How can I help?"
}

Adjust the path, fields, and host/port according to your implementation.

### Sample conversation

User: "What's the weather today?"
Bot: "I can fetch weather for a city. Which city would you like?"

(Replace with real examples or transcript of the bot in action.)

## Testing

- Unit tests (if present):
  - Node: npm test
  - Python: pytest

- Linting:
  - npm run lint
  - flake8 / pylint

Add the actual test commands and coverage steps used in this repo.

## Development

- Code structure
  - /src or /app: core application code
  - /web: front-end (if any)
  - /tests: unit and integration tests
  - Dockerfile, .github/workflows/* for CI

- How to add a new connector:
  1. Implement the connector interface in CONNECTORS_DIR.
  2. Register the connector in the app configuration.
  3. Add tests and docs.

Tailor the development notes to the layout and conventions used in the repo.

## Deployment

Common deployment options:
- Docker image to any container host (AWS ECS, GCP Cloud Run, DigitalOcean).
- Deploy backend to a VPS and/or serverless platform.
- Use CI to build and push images; GitHub Actions example is in .github/workflows (if present).

Add specific instructions for the repository's chosen deployment approach.

## Configuration & customization

- Models: If you support multiple models, show how to switch them (e.g., MODEL_PROVIDER=openai).
- Response policies / intents: Where to add or change intent handlers.
- UI text and assets: Path to templates or UI components.
